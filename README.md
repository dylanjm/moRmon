=====================================================================================

The goal of moRmon is to provide the [Standard
Works](https://www.lds.org/topics/standard-works) (volumes of scripture
officially accepted as church doctrine) in tidy format for easy
analysis.

These data were organized by <http://scriptures.nephi.org/>. I have
simply made it easy to use from R.
