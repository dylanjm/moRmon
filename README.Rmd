===================================================================

The goal of moRmon is to provide the [Standard Works](https://www.lds.org/topics/standard-works) (volumes of scripture officially accepted as church doctrine) in tidy format for easy analysis. 

These data were organized by http://scriptures.nephi.org/. I have simply made it easy to use from R.
